Some of the most important details you will thus get from system information utility include the laptop model, services currently installed and running, a detailed information about the hardware components like the disk drive and devices.

                    <h3>Basic Information of Television</h3>
                    <p>Television is a system for transmitting visual images and sound that are reproduced on screens, chiefly used to broadcast programs for entertainment, information, and education. The television set has become a commonplace in many households, businesses, and institutions. It is a major vehicle for advertising. Few inventions have had as much effect on contemporary American society as television. Jeff Greenfield, a media observer, stated “Television is the pervasive American pass time cutting through geographic, ethnic class and cultural diversity, it is the single binding thread of this country, the one experience that touches young and old, rich and poor, learned and illiterate (Biagi, 2005). In 1948, only 1 percent of America’s households had a TV set; by 1953 more than 50 percent had one; and since the early 1960’s, more than 90 percent of all homes have a television set (Campbell, Martin & Fabos, 2012). From mechanical television to electronic television, there continues to be a shift in how televisions are viewed today.

                    <h3>Basic Information Camera</h3>
                    <p>A digital camera is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory. Most cameras produced today are digital,[1] largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film. Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still avaliable).[2] High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.[3]

Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device.[4] The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.

                    <h3>Basic Information Speaker</h3>
                    <p>Speakers are used to connect to a computer to generate sound, which are one of the most common output devices. Some speakers are designed to connect with any kind of sound system, while some can be hooked up only with computers. With the computer speaker, the computer's sound card creates a signal that is used to produce sound. The primary objective of speakers is to offer audio output for the listener. The electromagnetic waves are converted into sound waves through the speaker as they are transducers. The devices, like an audio receiver or computer, give audio input to speakers, which may be in the form of analog or digital. The function of the analog speaker is simply to magnify the analog electromagnetic waves into sound waves.
